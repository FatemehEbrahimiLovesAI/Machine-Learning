# KNN Regression Demo Notebook

This repository contains the `main.ipynb` notebook, which demonstrates a simple **k‑Nearest Neighbors Regression** workflow using scikit‑learn and the `mglearn` dataset utilities.

## Contents
- Importing required libraries  
- Loading the Wave dataset (`mglearn.datasets.make_wave`)  
- Splitting the data into training and test sets  
- Training a **KNeighborsRegressor** model  
- Evaluating the model performance  

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn mglearn matplotlib numpy
```

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or VSCode.
2. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the regression model training and evaluation.

## File
- `main.ipynb` — The complete notebook containing the workflow.
