# Car Evaluation Classification using KNN

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict the acceptability of cars based on various features.
The model achieves 92% accuracy on the test dataset.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains categorical features describing different attributes of cars (buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety level). The target variable indicates the car's acceptability.

## The workflow includes:

#### Data preprocessing

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder.



#### Model building

K-Nearest Neighbors classifier with k=7.



#### Model evaluation

Achieved an accuracy of 92%.
